# Getting Started with Twilio Video (Beta!)

This is an example project demonstrating the basic use of Twilio's current Video APIs. In order to use this code, you'll need access to the video beta - [request early access here](https://www.twilio.com/video/request-early-access).

Note that this code uses a special pre-release version of the [Twilio Node.js module](https://twilio.github.io/twilio-node), which is why `node_modules` has been added to git.
