# Getting Started with Twilio Video (Beta!)

This is an example project demonstrating the basic use of Twilio's current Video APIs. In order to use this code, you'll need access to the video beta - [request early access here](https://www.twilio.com/video/request-early-access).

## NOTE

This example uses a special pre-release version of the Twilio Node.js helper library, checked in at `/twilio`. When Video goes GA, it would be best to use the module from npm.
